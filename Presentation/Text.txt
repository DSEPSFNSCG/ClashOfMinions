For our project we developed a turn-based two player strategy-boardgame called Clash of Minions. 

(Battlefield with a few minions)       

The game takes place on a battlefield, where two groups of minions are fighting each other fiercely.       

(Victory Screen)

To win the game one of your minions has to reach the enemyâ€™s baseline.          

(Battlefield many minions)                                       

Both players take turns in placing their customizable minions on the battlefield,
from where on they move and fight on their own.              

(Battlefield many minions with popup) 

A minion can be created with different attributes, such as health, attack-damage, shield, several buffs and so on.                                                          

To adjust the attributes of a minion the sliders below the battlefield can be used 
to distribute a number of points per turn.

The many different combinations enable different strategies for the players.
